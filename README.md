# Parking Lot System Project
This project was made to practice working with Object-Oriented Programming within Python.

The program allows a user to enter their vehicle's type and license plate number at which
their vehicle is shown within the system. The system's UI shows an ASCII version of the parking grid,
which allows the user to see the number of available spaces as well as what types of vehicles are currently
parked within the lot. The system also tracks a user's time within the lot, and will calculate a fare when their vehicle
is removed.
